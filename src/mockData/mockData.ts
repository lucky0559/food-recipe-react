    recipes: [
      "2 cans cherry pie filling",
      "Egg",
      "1/2 cup salted butter",
      "1/4 cup granulated sugar",
      "Yellow cake mix",
      "8oz cream cheese"
    ],
    procedures: [
      "Pour the pie filling into the bottom of the pan",
      "Beat the cream cheese, egg, and sugar in a medium mixing bowl using an electric mixer",
      "Drop spoonfuls of the whipped cream cheese mixture on top of the cherry pie filling. I do not spread them out",
      "Sprinkle the boxed cake mix evenly on top of the cream cheese layer",
      "Cover the top of the cake mix with very thin pats of butter, so as much is covered as possible. Alternately, you can grate the butter on a cheese grater",
      "The grated butter gives the most coverage without having to use additional pats. I think it also might be a smidge faster",
      "Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes or until the filling is bubbly and the topping is browned",
      "If needed, add sliced or melted butter to the dry spots of the cake mix in the last few minutes of baking",
      "Allow the dump cake to rest for 15 minutes, then serve with ice cream and/or whipped cream"
